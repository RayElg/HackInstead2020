[Compare Me](https://rayelg.github.io/HackInstead2020/)

### Origin
This respository is a submission for the [HackInstead2020](https://www.hackworks.com/en/hack-instead). 
This program was made as a part of a joint collaboration between the four members to create a program 
over the span of 48 hours. The final agreed upon program was to create a program in which a user 
fills in a form about themselves; through which their information is displayed
agaisnt global averages and world wide trends, to further give the user a better idea on their ranking among
the world.

##### Running Locally

If one wishes to access this site locally, (such as to modify & test their own branch of it), 
the user is required to import the Github files. The next step is to use open terminal and print the
file path folder containing the files.

Ex:
```
cd C:\Users\Admin\Documents\GitHub\HackInstead2020
```
Once path has been established, the next thing required is to start hosting it. This is done by using the following command in the terminal under your path.
Ex:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
A confirmation message will in terminal letting the User know that the file is being hosted. This message will look like this:
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) . . .
```
Once this prompt appears, posting the domain URL in the search bar of any web browser will allow you to be directed towards the program and begin using it:
```
http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
